# Words in Shakespeare
This Shiny app allows the user to explore the words in Shakespeare's plays. By typing in a word of their choice, the user will be shown: 
* The number of times the word appears in Shakespeare's plays
* Which play uses the word the most times
* What type of play uses the word most relative to other words
* A random quotation using the word

The deployed app can be found [here](https://meganstodel.shinyapps.io/shakespeare-words/).
